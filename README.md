# Morning-Brief 
OSU Spring Hackathon "Leverage AI"-themed creation that uses GPT-3.5, OpenWeatherMap, cheerio, and nodemailer to send you a daily AI-synthesized text message at 7am alerting you to the forecast for the day, a couple top tech new headlines from The Verge, and a fact about space. Runs perpetually on Render.com. Calendar information to come once I solve the Outlook authentication maze.
